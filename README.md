# Rihal Devops Model

Data modelling for the [Rihal Deveops Assigment](https://github.com/rihal-om/rihal-challenges/tree/main/devops).

## Structure

This package contains a Javascript file containing classes and modules to model the following:

- Objects (ES6 classes):
  - Class
  - Country
  - Student
- Tables (ES6 classes):
  - Classes table (class)
  - Countries table (class)
  - Students table (class)
- Controllers (IIFE modules):
  - Classes controller
  - Countries controller
  - Students controller

To avoid overengineering and for simplicities sake:

- All code is kept in a single file
- Data will be stored in the user's local storage
  - i.e., no backend frameworks used
